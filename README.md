Project Name
Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

Description
The project aims to predict the customer lifetime value (CLV) using regression techniques based on historical transaction data. It calculates RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics, additional features like Tenure, Average Order Value (AOV), and Purchase Frequency, and then trains a linear regression model to predict the monetary value a customer will bring to the business.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Hariharan2134/CodeClauseInternship_Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction.git
cd CodeClauseInternship_Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction
Install dependencies:

Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Install necessary Python packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
pip install statsmodels  # Only if using lowess in seaborn
Usage
Dataset:

Place your dataset file (OnlineRetail.csv) in the project directory.
Run the script:

Execute the Python script Customer Lifetime Value.py:

bash
Copy code
python "Customer Lifetime Value.py"
This script will perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It will output metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score, as well as visualizations like RFM distributions, correlation heatmap, residual plot, and actual vs. predicted scatter plot.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
statsmodels (optional, required only if using lowess in seaborn)
Files
Customer Lifetime Value.py: Main Python script for CLV prediction.
OnlineRetail.csv: Sample dataset file (replace with your actual dataset).
